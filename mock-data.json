I will need to take some time without work to develop the project and learn how to make Android apps, and I will need to fund server and hosting costs.",

It may be crazy because I came up with it at 3 in the morning while trying to soothe the baby, but it may be crazy enough to work!  I would like to invent a vibrating crib mat to help lull the baby to sleep.  Perhaps we will then both get some rest.",

I want it to notice when we're low on something and automatically create a grocery list, then order those items and have them delivered.  I also want to be able to tell it to order new items when I ask it to.  It should also be able to dance.  I've never built a robot before, so I'll need lots of funding for all of the mistakes I'm going to make.",
